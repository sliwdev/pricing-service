You’re implementing a part of a shopping platform. Design and implement a service that will provide a REST API for calculating a price for a given product and its amount. Products in the system are identified by UUID. There should be the possibility of applying discounts based on two policies – amount based (the more pieces of the product are ordered, the bigger the discount is) and percentage based. Policies should be configurable.
Additional remarks:
• Use Java >= 8 and frameworks of your choice
• Project should be containerized, and it should be easy to build and run it via gradle or maven. Please provide README file with instructions on how to launch it
• There's no need for full test coverage. Implement only most essential (in your opinion) tests
• Use git repository for developing the project and after you’re done, send us link to it
• Make sure we can run the project easily, without any unnecessary local dependencies (eg. Don’t use OS specific code)
• Try not to spend more than one or two evening on the assignment
• You will eventually have a chance to explain your code on next stage of the interview
Good luck!
